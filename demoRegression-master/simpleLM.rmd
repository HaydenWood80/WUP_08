## Compare all models   

predict LENGTH other than NECK. Then order them from worst to best by its value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better), or by RSE (residual standard error) where smaller is better.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## make a simple regression model

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
#adjust factors to be factors
bears$SEX<- as.factor(bears$SEX)
bears$MONTH<- as.factor(bears$MONTH)
```



## Model LENGTH ~ NECK  this is an example  

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

The best simple model, so far is Length-AGE is best
```{r}
set.seed(123)
group <- c(rep("A", 50), rep("B", 50))
value <- c(rnorm(50, mean = 10, sd = 2), rnorm(50, mean = 12, sd = 2))
data <- data.frame(Group = group, Value = value)

```
